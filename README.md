# Connections

## Project Breakdown

**Frontend:**

- **Technology:** React.js
- **Main Features:**
  - Navigation to the game page and a play button.
  - A 4x4 grid display for the game tiles with words.
  - Interaction for selecting tiles and submitting guesses.
  - Feedback mechanism for correct/incorrect guesses.
  - Display for remaining guesses and game over condition.

**Backend:**

- **Technology:** Flask
- **Main Features:**
  - API to generate game tiles with words and connections (using your GPT prompt).
  - Mechanism to validate player guesses and manage game state (correct guesses, incorrect guesses, and game over logic).
  - Database interaction for storing game states or user progress (if needed for future features like leaderboards or user accounts).

### Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

**Step 1: Setup Your Project Environment**

- Initialize a new React app (using Create React App for simplicity).
- Set up a Python backend using Flask or Django (Flask for simplicity, Django for more built-in features).

**Step 2: Design Your Game Logic and Data Structure**

- Define the data structure for your game grid, player guesses, and validations.
- Implement the game logic on the backend to handle the generation of words, connections, and validation of guesses.

**Step 3: Develop the Frontend**

- Implement the game interface in React with components for the game grid, play button, submit guess button, and feedback displays.
- Use state management (React's useState or useReducer hooks) to handle game states on the frontend.

**Step 4: Backend API Development**

- Develop an API endpoint to generate the game grid based on the GPT prompt.
- Create API endpoints to handle guesses, validate them, and manage game state (number of incorrect guesses, game over condition).

**Step 5: Integrating Frontend with Backend**

- Use React to fetch from your backend API to populate the game grid.
- Handle user interactions (tile selections, guess submissions) and communicate with the backend for validation and game state updates.

**Step 6: Testing and Debugging**

- Test the game thoroughly to ensure all interactions work as expected and debug any issues.

**Step 7: Deployment**

- Deploy your React application and Python backend to a web server or cloud service (like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel for the frontend).

### Additional Suggestions

- **User Experience:** Consider adding animations or visual cues for feedback on correct/incorrect guesses.
- **Scalability:** If planning for multiplayer or high user volume, ensure your backend is scalable.
- **Security:** Implement security best practices, especially if you plan to add user accounts or handle sensitive data.
