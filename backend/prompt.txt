Generate four sets of four single words, each derived from diverse categories such as nature, technology, emotions, and historical or cultural significance. Ensure the internal connection of each set is not overly obvious, selecting words that possess alternate meanings which could subtly connect to at least one word in another set, thereby enriching the interaction and engagement potential. The connections within each set should be specific and clear, avoiding broad or multi-category connections. Examples of the level of specificity and engagement desired include connections like "Named after famous people," "Named after famous locations," "Segment of a process," "Constellations," "Notable TV episodes," "Treat with excessive care," "Things in a spa locker room," and "Areas of academic focus." It is crucial that each word in the sets is a single word to maintain consistency and clarity, essential for the seamless integration into my app. Each word must also be unique across all sets to ensure variety and avoid redundancy. After each set, provide a concise explanation of the relationship in less than four words, adhering to this consistent format: "Word 1, Word 2, Word 3, Word 4: Relationship". Importantly, the response should exclusively include the four sets of words and their connections in the specified format, omitting any additional text to align perfectly with my app development needs.
