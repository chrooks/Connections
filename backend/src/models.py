"""
This module defines the database models for the Connections game using SQLAlchemy. It includes the definition of the game session model `ConnectionsGame` which stores all relevant game information such as the game grid, connections, and game status. It also includes the `GameStatus` enum for defining possible game states.

Classes:
- GameStatus: Enum defining possible states of a game session.
- ConnectionsGame: SQLAlchemy model representing a game session in the database.

Functions:
- make_connections_mutable(connections): Helper function to make connection dictionaries mutable for SQLAlchemy tracking.
